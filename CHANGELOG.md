# Changelog for HelpDesk

## v1.1.0.3

`Documentation`:

Updating the Repo owner name to `TechDufus`.
  - This was a rename of the repo, not an ownership change.
  - I feel this warranted a version bump to get this updated in all help docs for this module.

## v1.1.0.2

`Get-LockedOutADUsers`: Aliased as `GLO`

+ Added an additional warning message for users who do now have permissions to perform `-IncludeLockoutSource`
  + This message points them to the help documentation with a suggestion on the permissions they might need to do this in their domain.

## v1.1.0

`New Features!`:

+ `Get-LockedOutADUsers`: Aliased as `GLO`
  + This function just got a big feature for those admins who have access.
  + This function can now provide the source of the user lockout event.
    + You must have rights to query your domain controller for Security Event Logs.
      + See `Get-Help GLO -Parameter IncludeLockoutSource` for more information on read access to DC logs.
  + See `Get-Help GLO -Parameter IncludeLockoutSource` for more information.
  + With this, the following command will now be possible (if you have domain rights):

```txt
PS> GLO -IncludeLockoutSource

Name                SamAccountName LockoutTime        LockoutSource
----                -------------- -----------        -------------

+ Syntax changes in function definitions
  + This does not contain any features or major code changes.

## v1.0.5

+ Misc. code improvements.

## v1.0.4

## v1.0.2

+ Get-LockedOutADUsers no longer gives output if there are no users locked out.
